# DroneSystem
I started working on this system back in November of 2021 and had the [first working show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsQ76SjTkMc) in January of 2022.
As of November of 2022, it has been used two times in total.

Working with this system was a pain in the ass because of how the way I wrote it.
I'm probably not gonna use it anymore in the near future so I hope that anyone out there might find it useful for their shows.

I know the code is bad, you don't have to tell me about it. Hate it, laugh at it, complain about it, love it, I do not care.
